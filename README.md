# Overview

Code for my undergraduate thesis *Wise Deliberating Crowds*: *The Epistemic Quality of Group Decisions in a Probabilistic Model of Deliberation*.

**Abstract**: We present a nuanced investigation of the epistemic quality of collective deci- sions within a probabilistic model of deliberation. We extend Chingoma and Haret (2023) to a probabilistic framework, introducing a richer basis for the classification of epistemic performance. We situate our model between two traditions of epistemic democrat thought - the aggregative-probabilistic faction rooted in Condorcetâ€™s Jury Theorem and the faction of deliberative democrats. Our findings provide (1) formal bounds that produce epistemic competence in the first rounds of the deliberations and (2) a simulations-backed critical assessment of four hypotheses regarding fac- tors influencing group competence - group size, diversity and the initial minority - paving the way for future research.
